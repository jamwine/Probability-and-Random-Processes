    "**Total independence**, also known as **pairwise independence**, refers to a situation where each pair of events in a collection of events is independent of each other. In other words, if we have a set of events $(A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_n)$, they are considered totally independent if the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event $A_i$ does not provide any information about the occurrence of any other event $A_j$ where $i \\neq j$.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total independence** implies that events are independent in a pairwise manner, but it does not necessarily imply that the events are mutually independent when considering larger combinations of events.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mutual independence**, also known as **oint independence**, is a stronger concept. Events are considered mutually independent if the occurrence or non-occurrence of any subset of events in a collection does not provide any information about the occurrence of any other event in the collection.\n",

    "Mathematically, events $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_n$ are mutually independent if and only if the following condition holds for every possible subset of events:\n",

    "$$ P\\left(\\bigcap_{i \\in I} A_i\\right) = \\prod_{i \\in I} P(A_i)$$\n",

    "where $I$ is a subset of ${1, 2, \\ldots, n}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, **mutual independence** extends the concept of independence to any combination of events, not just pairwise combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between total independence and mutual independence lies in the scope of their independence. Total independence only considers the pairwise independence of events, while mutual independence considers the independence of any combination of events, including subsets larger than two.\n",

    "For example, consider three events $A$, $B$, and $C$. If these events are totally independent, it means that $A$ is independent of $B$, $A$ is independent of $C$, and $B$ is independent of $C$. However, mutual independence requires that all possible combinations of these events (e.g., $A$ and $B$, $A$ and $C$, $B$ and $C$, and $A$, $B$, and $C$ together) are independent.\n",

    "### Expressing Bayes' Theorem using the Theorem of Total Probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' Theorem can be expressed in terms of the Theorem of Total Probability when dealing with events and their partitions. Recall the Theorem of Total Probability, which states that for any event $A$ and a partition of the sample space $B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_n$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A) = \\sum_{i=1}^n P(A \\cap B_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^n P(B_i) \\cdot P(A|B_i) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's consider two events, $A$ and $B$, and their partitions $B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_n$, where $B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_n$ form a partition of the sample space. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional probability $P(B_i|A)$ to the conditional probability $P(A|B_i)$:\n",

    "Bayes' Theorem, which relates conditional probabilities of events, can be derived and expressed using the Theorem of Total Probability, which deals with the probability of events within partitions of the sample space. The two theorems are closely related and provide a powerful framework for updating probabilities based on new evidence or information.\n",

    "- $ P(S) $: The prior probability that an email is spam (e.g., $0.2$, indicating $20\\%$ of incoming emails are spam).\n",
    "- $ P(F|S) $: The probability that the spam filter correctly classifies an email as spam (e.g., $0.95$, indicating a $95\\%$ true positive rate for spam).\n",
    "- $ P(F|\\neg S) $: The probability that the spam filter incorrectly classifies a non-spam email as spam (e.g., $0.02$, indicating a $2\\%$ false positive rate).\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to calculate $ P(S|F) $, the probability that an email is spam given that it has been classified as spam by the filter."

    "- **Poisson Distribution**: Models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.\n",
